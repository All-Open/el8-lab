This folder contains LAB source code and build instructions.

# Installation

The good news is you don't have to (and shouldn't) build this RPM unless you want to contribute.

In order to have LAB RPM installed, please follow [LABS](../LABS.md) instructions.

# Building LAB RPM

All the work is done by executing `./build.sh` script. It requires `docker`, builds a container, and builds the RPM inside.

The script is a bit hacky, but it provides a super-simple way of building and RPM :)
