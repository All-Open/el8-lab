# Welcome!
Welcome to All Open Enterprise Linux 8 Labs!

The purpose of this project is to test and develop your `Enterprise Linux 8` skills, whether you are using `CentOS 8`, `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8` or any other derivative. Best of all, it's absolutely free.

Review the [`Labs`](labs/index.md), attempt to complete them, and check your results automatically with an RPM package which is part of this repo.

This repo is maintained by [All Open](https://all-open.com), and is actively used during [Enterprise Linux 8 In Action](https://all-open.com/enterprise-linux-8-in-action-training-workshop) training course.

TODO: Thank mkdocs guys!
